## Project Trello Board:

https://trello.com/b/tXM2NIgT/slo-stance

&nbsp;

## Directories:

"notes-word-documents" directory - Word document files containing notes on background concepts and materials for SLO Topic Modeling.

"datasets" directory - contains Twitter datasets.

"jupyter-notebooks" directory - contains Jupyter Notebook files and images.

"json" directory - contains original raw JSON file used in SLO Stance Classification.

"deprecated" - files that are no longer relevant.

Note: some directories not listed here as not included in GitHub Repository.

&nbsp;

## "datasets" directory:

anything with "LDA_PROCESSED" - used in SLO LDA topic extraction.

anything with "PROCESSED" only - used in SLO TBL topic classification.

other .csv files are original files obtained from the Borg supercomputer.

Note: large datasets are not included in GitHub Repository.

&nbsp;

## "jupyter-notebooks" directory:

"slo-lda-introduction.ipynb" - Introduction to latent dirichlet allocation and topic modeling.

"slo-lda-implementation.ipynb" - Our implementation of LDA on our Twitter dataset.

"slo-lda-grid-search.ipynb" - Exhaustive grid search for Scikit-Learn LDA model hyper parameters.

"slo-lda-execution-output.ipynb" - multiple executions and associated topic extraction output for our LDA implementation.

"SLO analysis.ipynb" - from the Calvin College SLO-Classifier repository.

"slo-twitter-data-analysis.ipynb" - adapted from SLO analysis.ipynb for SLO Twitter dataset analysis.

"personal-research-journal.ipynb" - Jupyter notebook file for keeping research notes.

"lda-presentation-images" sub-directory -  image files for LDA Jupyter Notebook files.

"lda-presentation-markdown-tables" sub-directory - table files for markdown and html tables used in LDA Jupyter Notebook files.

&nbsp;

## Files in root Directory:

This README.md file.

"scikit-learn-lda-example.py" - Example of Scikit-Learn implementation of LDA.

"slo_lda_topic_extraction_utility_functions.py" - utility functions for LDA topic extraction.
